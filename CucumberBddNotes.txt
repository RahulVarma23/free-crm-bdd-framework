1. open source tool which support BDD with multiple lan binding java, js, c# ,python, perl
2. plain english syntax, easy to understand
3. we can involve people from non-tech background . Devs , BA , product owner can contribute to feature/scenarios
4. increases code reusability

Disadvantages:
1. extra rework in case test team doesn't receive scenarios in gherkin with reqs
2. limited support with parallel execution and cross browser testing

plugins: Gherkin, cucumber

dependencies: selenium , cucumber-java, cucumber-core, cucumber-junit, gherkin , webdriver manager

cucumber options:

1.feature - specify feature file path
2. glue - specify step def path
3. dryrun - checks if steps defs are mapped to feature
4. monochrome - formats the console output
5. plugin - to generate reports or add additional features

Logger: used to log messages or actions performed
1. add log4j dependency
2. add logger configuration file log4j2.xml or log4j2-test.xml under src/test/resources
3. create logger instance in step def classes
4. write log statements

extent reports:open source reporting library .used to generate beautiful, lucrative reports with detailed execution summary and some pie charts
1. add dependency of cucumber extent report adapter
2. add config files extent.properties and extent-config.xml
3. add plugin to test runner : plugin = { "com.aventstack.extentreports.cucumber.adapter.ExtentCucumberAdapter:"}
4. modify screenshot method to take screenshot
